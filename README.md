# Advent of Code 
## Day 1: No-Time-For-a-Taxicab
My solution to solving the Day 1, Advent of Code 2016 Puzzle. You can input any directions you are given and it will return how many blocks away you are.

## Day 2: Bathroom Security
Enter how many lines you have and enter your lines of code. This may need some adjustments, simply because it did not calculate the last direction, but it does list the correct keypad coordinate next to Direction.

##Day 3: Squares With Three Sides
Enter how many lines there are and the input you were given. Returns how many impossible triangles there are and how many possible triangles there are.
